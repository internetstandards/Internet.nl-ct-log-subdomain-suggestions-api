# Internet.nl Certificate Transparency Log Subdomain Suggestions


## What does this do / Intended use case
The goal is to replace subdomain suggestions from crt.sh with higher uptime and faster response times. This way it can
be used in other applications, such as the internet.nl dashboard, to suggest possible subdomains to end users.


## How does it work
This tool ingests subdomains from public certificate transparency logs using a connection from a certstream server. A
web interface allows for querying the stored data, which results in a list of known subdomains.

There are several optimizations performed that reduce the amount of subdomains stored in the database. The most
important one is the list of allowed tlds that are being stored. By default only domains relevant to the Kingdom of
the Netherlands are being stored. You can configure this to your preferred zones.

To pre-fill the database, it's possible to import data from merklemap. This is a list of 700M hostnames which can be
imported in bulk. A sample export containing the entire list of .nl subdomains is included as a sample fixture. This
can be loaded up with the command `python3.12 manage.py loaddata export_merklemap_nl_zone_2024_20_25`. A newer
fixture might be present. This contains 5.991.724 records. -> Git refused this, so just import this by hand.


## What are the limits of this tool
The limits have not yet been discovered and no optimizations have been performed yet, aside from a few proactive
database indexes. It is expected to being able to store about a years worth of data from the .nl zone. The preload
from merklemap will load up 6 million subdomains (which is much lower than the expected 50 million).

For the Netherlands the total number of certificate renewals seems to be much lower for subdomains,
between 0.5 to 2 per second. Each subdomain which will have a new certificate every 90 days. This is the same in
most EU countries. There is no expectation that this tool will work quickly on the combined com/net/org zones.
Although some partitioning and smarter inserting might just do the trick.

The goal is to being able to run this on medium sized virtual machines with just a few cores and a few gigabytes of
ram. That should be enough for the Netherlands and most EU countries. We've not tried to see if this solution is 'web
scale'.


## How to ingest data from cerstream
Configure `CTLSSA_CERTSTREAM_SERVER_URL` to point to a certstream-server instance. The default points to a certstream
server hosted by the creator of certstream, calidog. This is great for testing and development, but don't use it for
production purposes.

Read more about setting up a certstream server here: https://github.com/CaliDog/certstream-server

After configuration run the following command:
```python manage.py migrate```
```python manage.py ingest```

This command should run forever. In case your certstream server is down it will patiently wait until the server is up.


## How to query the results
The webserver can be started with the command:
```python manage.py runserver```

When you visit the web interface at http://localhost:8001/ you will see a blank JSON response. Use the following
parameters to retrieve data: `http://localhost:8001/?domain=example&suffix=nl&period=365`


## Further configuration options
Configuration is done via environment variables, but can also be hardcoded in the settings.py file if need be.

Everything is configured with environment variables and fallbacks. Environment variables of the app are prefixed with
CTLSSA_, so they stand out in your `env`.

CTLSSA_ACCEPTED_TLDS: Comma separated string with the zones you want subdomains from.
The default is set to "nl,aw,cw,sr,sx,bq,frl,amsterdam,politie". Mileage will vary with .com, .net, .org zones and
we expect ingestion not to be fast enough.

DEQUE_LENGTH: Configure this to be around the amount of domains you ingest in a few hours to a day, but in a way that
it doesn't hit the database limit. This value is used to deduplicate certificate renewal requests. It's very common to
see certificate renewals containing the same domain for every subdomain. It's also very common to see the same request
happening over and over again because the administrator made some configuration mistake and needs to repeat the process.
The default is 100.000 domains.

There are various database settings so any django-supported database can be used. We recommend postgres as it has more
options regarding optimization than mysql. Either should be fine. Sqlite might also work, as there is only one process
that writes to the database.

Database settings:

- CTLSSA_DB_ENGINE
- CTLSSA_DB_NAME
- CTLSSA_DB_USER
- CTLSSA_DB_PASSWORD
- CTLSSA_DB_HOST
- CTLSSA_DJANGO_DATABASE


## Expectations in database size and performance

This package assumes that insertions in the database are faster than the amount of newly found domains. This will not
hold true for every zone, especially when combining .com, .net and .org.

Once this assumption doesn't hold optimizations are needed. There are several options that might help: bulk insert,
parallel inserts from multiple processes, database partitioning, index ordering, reducing the amount of indexes by
merging domain+suffix and so on. Other solutions might work as well. None of these have been tried yet, but you might
need them. If you do, please get in touch with the repository owner so this project can be optimized for everyone.


## Creating a fixture from merklemap

These steps remove all existing data and create a new fixture. This is useful for developers that want to create a
specific fixture on their own machines. Data is licensed cc by nc sa merklemap.

- `rm db.sqlite3 file`
- `python3 manage.py migrate`
- `python3.12 manage.py bulk_ingest --file=merklemap_dns_records_database_25_10_2024.xz` (or decompressed .jsonl)
- `python3.12 manage.py dumpdata suggestions.domain > suggestions_domain_25_10_2024.json`
- `xz -9 -c suggestions_domain_25_10_2024.json > suggestions_domain_25_10_2024.json.xz`

Load up the data elsewhere using:

`python3.12 manage.py loaddata export_merklemap_nl_zone_2024_20_25`


## Development

This project uses Docker and Compose for development and deployment. Common used actions for development are found in the `Makefile`.

Requirements for development are:

- Docker (eg: Docker for Mac, Colima, OrbStack)
- Compose
- GNU make

### Checking out the code

This repository contains submodules, so after the Git clone this submodule should be initialized.

    git clone git@github.com:internetstandards/Internet.nl-ct-log-subdomain-suggestions-api.git
    git submodule update --init

### Building the application

Before running the application, or whenever code changes, the Docker images need to be built. For this run:

    make build

Running the build step before every command is recommended to ensure the images are up to date, that's why it's included in all the command below. It can be omitted if you know you don't need it.

### Running application

To run the application for development use:

    make build run

This will start a full development stack with:

  - uWSGI application
  - ingest
  - certstream server
  - postgreSQL server
  - database migration

A web interface will be available at `http://localhost:8001`.

Compose will watch for file changes and restart the required services accordingly.

### Linting

Run these commands before checking in. These should all pass without error.

    make build lint

*notice*: this command autofixes trivial issues in formatting and updates the source files

### Testing

To run the test suite use:

    make build test

To rerun tests every time a file changes use:

    make build test-watch

### Development shell

To open a shell with all dependencies and development tools installed, first bring the project up, then run:

    make build dev

From here you can run the `ctlssa` command to perform Django `./manage.py` functions like:

    ctlssa makemigrations

    ctlssa shell

    ctlssa loadfixtures testdata

    ctlssa bulk_ingest --file data.json

For all commands run:

    ctlssa --help

### Dependency management

After changing requirements in any of the `.in` files update the `.txt` files using:

    make build requirements

### Database shell (postgresql)

    make dbshell
